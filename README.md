== Pitch ==

One of the keys to being successful, is surrounding yourself with smart, likeminded people, preferably more successful than you are. Finding the right group for you to thrive can be difficult.

Starting and maintaining a mastermind group, on the other hand, is a lot of work. You’ll need to find the right tools that will work for all participants. Tools that will generate the right group dynamic, and will benefit the users – at the same time allow you to monetize your efforts. Our platform enables people to form their own or join existing mastermind groups.

A mastermind group is a peer-to-peer mentoring concept used to help members solve their problems with input and advice from the other group members. The concept was coined in 1925 by author Napoleon Hill in his book The Law of Success, and described in more detail in his 1937 book, Think and Grow Rich. In his books, Hill discussed the idea of the Master Mind, which referred to two or more people coming together in harmony to solve problems.
